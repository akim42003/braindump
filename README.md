# braindump

I needed to offload my thoughts on tech, science, and programming. Engineered with a back to the basics approach and for my eyes only.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS because my PNPM got messed up (jk I wanted to learn JS for reals).
- **Backend**: Node.js + SQLite because who needs scale when only you can see.
- **Deployment**: Docker on the $300 pre-Ryzen AMD PC I made in 7th grade hiding behind ZeroTier VPN
- **Security**: Security through obscurity (actually just good VPN and ufw isolation)

## Why?

Sometimes you just want to write words without fighting webpack configs or debating which state management library will be deprecated next week.

Built for an audience of me, deployed to a network of my apple eco system plus those pesky edge devices and my Ubuntu AI monster PC.
